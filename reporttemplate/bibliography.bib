abstract = {Tradable credit schemes (TCS) have been promoted as an alternative to congestion pricing in recent years. Most existing TCS studies assume a frictionless trading market that incurs zero transaction cost. In this study, we propose to examine how transaction cost, taking the form of brokerage fee charged by a TCS operator for the deal-matching service, impacts the performance of TCS in the context of morning commute. Unlike the existing studies, the brokerage fee is assumed to be proportional to the transaction value and asymmetrically split between buyers and sellers. Using the bottleneck model, the optimal TCS design is first obtained for the case of homogeneous commuters and asymmetric transaction cost. We also derive the conditions that ensure Pareto-improving for commuters and financial self-sufficiency for the operator. The latter means the brokerage fee can cover the operator’s cost. These analytical results are then extended to cases considering user heterogeneity—which allows commuters to have different values of times (VOT) and desired arrival times at the workplace—and coarse charging design. Among other things, we find that an asymmetric fee structure is better for system performance when buyers bear a higher share of the transaction cost.}

abstract = {Tradable credit schemes offer a potentially efficient, revenue-neutral policy alternative to classical dynamic pricing of congestion externalities. We show in this paper that the resulting equilibrium may not be unique for particular models of congestion, including the first-best solution for the conventional Vickrey's bottleneck model. This can have substantial detrimental impacts on social welfare and social acceptance of tradable credit schemes. The reason underlying this result is that the credit supply-demand condition can be satisfied for a continuum of credit prices. This is because any marginal change in the credit price will be matched by a compensating change in queuing times, keeping user price fixed but deviating from the first-best optimum in which no queueing should occur. We find that the problem of non-uniqueness does not occur for the dynamic flow congestion model proposed by Chu. A unique equilibrium can be obtained in the bottleneck model if the buying and selling of credits with a bank is allowed, against a pre-determined price. Credits are then still tradable so that the use can deviate from the initial distribution, but the credit price is determined by the perfectly elastic demand and supply from the bank.}
